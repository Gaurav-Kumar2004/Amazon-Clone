# Amazon-Clone
"Exciting news! I just finished my first project using HTML and CSS – an Amazon India clone! It was a fun adventure creating something that looks and feels like the real deal. With just HTML and CSS, I've brought to life a virtual shopping experience that's easy to navigate and looks awesome. Check it out and let me know what you think!"
